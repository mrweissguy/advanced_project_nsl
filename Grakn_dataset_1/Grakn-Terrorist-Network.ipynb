    "# Grakn Terrorist Network\n",
    "\n",
    "Grakn is an open-source knowledge base for creating and storing ontologies. It is considered AI on its own as it can be used to infer information from relationships and thus discover new insights. However, traditional machine learning algorithms or deep neural networks cannot be created for the data while it is situated in Grakn. The data must be exported before this can be done. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for involving Grakn in this project is to exemplify what a full pipeline might look like in a real-life scenario. Firms might host their data in a database, e.g. Grakn, and want to built a state-of-the-art machine learning algorithm around their data for a number of reasons. One could be to execute on a strategic transformation goal of becoming more data-driven.\n",
    "\n",
    "A [simple version](https://github.com/sinyil/ntds_2018_Final_Project/tree/master/CSV%20Files) of Dataset 1 (Terrorist relations) is used is this only example of Grakn usage.\n",
